## Ensemble Methods

In this Repository, We consider the use of Ensemble Methods. Specifically the use of the Voting Clasifier and the Stacking Classifier. We perform a classification problem using scikit-learn, we then compare the results.

### Dataset
We consider the Kaggle dataset about 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster'. We split the train dataset to be able to make our own evaluations. The dataset can also be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv


### Note

StackingClassifier is only available in the scikit-learn in the version 0.22, while the Voting Classifier is available from the version 0.17.

To upgrade scikit-learn
*pip install --upgrade scikit-learn*
