## Ensemble Methods

In this Repository, We consider the use of Ensemble Methods. Specifically the use of the Voters-Ensemble Methods and the Stacking Classifier. We perform a classification problem using scikit-learn, we then compare the results.

### Dataset
We consider the Iris Dataset. The iris dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset.


### Note

StackingClassifier is only available in the scikit-learn in the version 0.22

*pip install --upgrade scikit-learn*
